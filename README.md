## Approach

1. I will start with a very simple menu class, which contains a hash 'dishes' that contains the dish and their price. 
* The second user story requires the ability to create an order with dishes. I will therefore change my original approach. I will now add a dish class and inject it into menu. Menu can create new dishes, which are stored in an hash. The key is the name of the dish and the value is the dish_instance. A dish consists of its name and price. #see_dishes will return all dish's with their #name and #price.
